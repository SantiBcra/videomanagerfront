Nebula,

00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:02.570
a dark brown

00:00:02.570 --> 00:00:03.040

00:00:04.569 --> 00:00:05.199
outwards,

00:00:05.479 --> 00:00:05.909
framed

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:06.310
against a

00:00:06.310 --> 00:00:06.850
background

00:00:06.850 --> 00:00:07.359
of bright

00:00:07.359 --> 00:00:08.180
blue gas.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:09.200
These

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:10.250
striking hues

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:10.680
are formed

00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:11.499
by combining

00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:11.910
several

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:13.760

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:14.670
taken with

00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:15.060
different

00:00:15.060 --> 00:00:15.390
colored

00:00:15.390 --> 00:00:15.950
filters,

00:00:16.349 --> 00:00:17.330
to reveal a

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:18.579
broad range

00:00:18.789 --> 00:00:19.580
of colors,

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:20.610
not normally

00:00:20.610 --> 00:00:20.823
visible

00:00:20.823 --> 00:00:21.251
to the

human eye,

00:00:21.678 --> 00:00:21.892
sitting

00:00:21.892 --> 00:00:25.430
about 6, 400

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:25.970
light years

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:26.975
away In the

00:00:26.985 --> 00:00:27.715
constellation

00:00:27.715 --> 00:00:28.445
of Orion,

00:00:29.175 --> 00:00:29.974
this violent

00:00:29.985 --> 00:00:30.415
stellar

00:00:30.415 --> 00:00:31.035
nursery

00:00:31.435 --> 00:00:32.005
contains

00:00:32.035 --> 00:00:32.485
all the

00:00:32.485 --> 00:00:33.185
ingredients

00:00:33.185 --> 00:00:33.615
needed

00:00:33.625 --> 00:00:34.135
for star

00:00:34.135 --> 00:00:34.835
formation.

00:00:35.845 --> 00:00:37.235
However, the

00:00:37.235 --> 00:00:38.085
recipe for

00:00:38.105 --> 00:00:38.645
cooking up

00:00:38.675 --> 00:00:39.575
new stars

00:00:39.614 --> 00:00:40.174
isn't very

00:00:40.175 --> 00:00:40.785
efficient,

00:00:41.334 --> 00:00:41.744
and most

00:00:41.744 --> 00:00:42.025
of these

00:00:42.025 --> 00:00:42.685
ingredients

00:00:42.685 --> 00:00:43.894
are wasted as

00:00:43.895 --> 00:00:44.455
the cloud of

00:00:44.455 --> 00:00:45.454
gas and dust

00:00:45.605 --> 00:00:46.125
gradually

00:00:46.145 --> 00:00:46.915
disperses.

00:00:48.194 --> 00:00:49.025
The rate at

00:00:49.065 --> 00:00:49.445
which the

00:00:49.445 --> 00:00:50.154
nebula is

00:00:50.154 --> 00:00:51.014
accelerated

00:00:51.065 --> 00:00:51.335
by the

00:00:51.335 --> 00:00:51.705
presence

00:00:51.705 --> 00:00:52.575
of fiery,

00:00:52.585 --> 00:00:53.535
hot, young

00:00:53.535 --> 00:00:54.175
stars,

00:00:54.794 --> 00:00:55.214
which trigger

00:00:55.214 --> 00:00:55.904
high velocity

00:00:55.904 --> 00:00:56.835
winds that

00:00:56.835 --> 00:00:57.135
help to

00:00:57.135 --> 00:00:57.905
blow the gas

00:00:57.964 --> 00:00:58.574
outwards.

00:00:59.739 --> 00:01:00.239
Launched

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:01.510
