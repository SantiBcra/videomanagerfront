00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:00.309
Taro

00:00:00.309 --> 00:00:02.379
Yamada, his

00:00:02.379 --> 00:00:03.079
fascination

00:00:03.089 --> 00:00:03.579
for seeing

00:00:03.579 --> 00:00:04.459
how unnatural

00:00:04.459 --> 00:00:05.009
Japanese

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:05.349
writing

00:00:05.349 --> 00:00:06.029
can be for

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:06.739
the West.

00:00:07.499 --> 00:00:08.319
Unintelligible

00:00:08.349 --> 00:00:09.199
ideograms,

00:00:09.459 --> 00:00:10.159
words without

00:00:10.159 --> 00:00:10.689
spaces

00:00:10.689 --> 00:00:11.009
written

00:00:11.019 --> 00:00:11.629
vertically,

00:00:11.899 --> 00:00:12.559
and read from

00:00:12.589 --> 00:00:13.369
up to down

00:00:13.409 --> 00:00:13.919
and right

00:00:13.929 --> 00:00:14.579
to left,

00:00:15.149 --> 00:00:15.749
sometimes

00:00:15.759 --> 00:00:16.379
with diffuse

00:00:16.419 --> 00:00:16.769
meaning

00:00:16.779 --> 00:00:17.399
in Western

00:00:17.399 --> 00:00:18.109
languages.

00:00:19.759 --> 00:00:20.599
But also he

00:00:20.599 --> 00:00:21.349
understands

00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:21.529
that

00:00:21.579 --> 00:00:22.279
originally

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:23.239
each ideogram

00:00:23.249 --> 00:00:23.609
was the

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:24.539
representation

00:00:24.579 --> 00:00:25.489
of an object,

00:00:25.929 --> 00:00:26.429
and there is

00:00:26.429 --> 00:00:27.179
no better way

00:00:27.179 --> 00:00:27.799
to return to

00:00:27.799 --> 00:00:28.499
the origin

00:00:28.739 --> 00:00:29.289
than to let

00:00:29.289 --> 00:00:29.959
the character

00:00:29.959 --> 00:00:30.409
become

00:00:30.409 --> 00:00:30.939
a thing.

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:32.270
Again,

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:34.010
this is his

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:34.960
definition of

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:35.760
a calligram.

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:37.080
His Western

00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:37.730
education

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:38.130
mixed with

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:38.740
Japanese

00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:39.860
roots places

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:40.210
him in the

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:40.710
middle of

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:41.180
something,

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:41.640
like a

00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:42.220
bridge.

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:43.140
All his

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:43.810
pieces are

00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:44.230
made in

00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:44.690
a special

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:45.720
paper, called

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:47.020
kinwashi, and

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:47.660
traditional

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:48.690
ink sumi e

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:49.560
follow the

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:50.360
Zen circle,

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:51.410
the Enso.

00:00:52.312 --> 00:00:53.522
An allegory

00:00:53.562 --> 00:00:54.332
or homage

00:00:54.332 --> 00:00:55.332
to Ikigai,

00:00:55.732 --> 00:00:56.532
which is a

00:00:56.542 --> 00:00:56.992
beautiful

00:00:56.992 --> 00:00:57.502
Japanese

00:00:57.502 --> 00:00:58.042
concept

00:00:58.052 --> 00:00:58.822
that means

00:00:58.862 --> 00:00:59.592
"the purpose

00:00:59.642 --> 00:01:00.372
of life".

00:01:00.862 --> 00:01:01.982
This title,

00:01:02.062 --> 00:01:02.962
Watashi no

00:01:02.992 --> 00:01:04.462
Ikigai, means

00:01:04.482 --> 00:01:05.232
the purpose

00:01:05.252 --> 00:01:06.102
of my life.

00:01:06.632 --> 00:01:07.522
It is somehow

00:01:07.532 --> 00:01:08.452
freedom that

00:01:08.462 --> 00:01:08.992
the artist

00:01:09.022 --> 00:01:09.972
takes not

00:01:09.992 --> 00:01:10.882
only to write

00:01:10.882 --> 00:01:11.762
vertically,

00:01:12.112 --> 00:01:13.002
but also to

00:01:13.002 --> 00:01:13.532
write in a

00:01:13.532 --> 00:01:14.132
curved line.

00:01:14.765 --> 00:01:15.525
The piece

00:01:15.625 --> 00:01:16.515
has a poem

00:01:16.565 --> 00:01:17.025
that goes

00:01:17.025 --> 00:01:17.515
like this.

00:01:18.015 --> 00:01:18.665
Where the

00:01:18.665 --> 00:01:19.755
ethereal bird

00:01:19.765 --> 00:01:21.015
rests, where

00:01:21.275 --> 00:01:21.915
the morning

00:01:22.085 --> 00:01:22.395
dawns.

00:01:23.075 --> 00:01:23.935
That is you.

00:01:24.015 --> 00:01:24.415
Where the

00:01:24.415 --> 00:01:25.375
candle flame

00:01:25.475 --> 00:01:26.055
does not

00:01:26.085 --> 00:01:26.645
tremble,

00:01:27.185 --> 00:01:27.635
where the

00:01:27.645 --> 00:01:28.415
time of

00:01:28.465 --> 00:01:29.115
everything

00:01:29.155 --> 00:01:29.985
is marked.

00:01:31.175 --> 00:01:31.465
It is

00:01:31.465 --> 00:01:32.225
important

00:01:32.315 --> 00:01:32.665
to point

00:01:32.685 --> 00:01:33.255
out that the

00:01:33.255 --> 00:01:34.185
ideogram that

00:01:34.185 --> 00:01:34.785
is in the

00:01:34.785 --> 00:01:35.575
center of the

00:01:35.575 --> 00:01:36.595
painting is

00:01:36.625 --> 00:01:37.795
the word YOU

00:01:38.135 --> 00:01:39.035
and the piece

00:01:39.195 --> 00:01:39.825
is nothing

00:01:39.825 --> 00:01:40.625
more than a

00:01:40.625 --> 00:01:41.305
love letter

00:01:41.305 --> 00:01:42.735
to explain

00:01:42.775 --> 00:01:43.275
to the loved

00:01:43.295 --> 00:01:43.905
one that

00:01:44.175 --> 00:01:45.035
my purpose

00:01:45.085 --> 00:01:46.255
in life is

00:01:46.505 --> 00:01:47.355
basically

00:01:47.755 --> 00:01:48.065
you.

00:01:49.172 --> 00:01:49.382
This

00:01:49.622 --> 00:01:50.182
