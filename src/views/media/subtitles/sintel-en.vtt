00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:00.709
Taro Yamada,

00:00:00.709 --> 00:00:01.430
his fascination

00:00:01.430 --> 00:00:02.079
for seeing how

00:00:02.079 --> 00:00:02.460
unnatural

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:03.300
Japanese writing

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:03.829
can be

00:00:03.829 --> 00:00:04.210
for the West.

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:05.739
Unintelligible ideograms,

00:00:05.739 --> 00:00:06.739
words without spaces

00:00:06.739 --> 00:00:07.499
written vertically,

00:00:07.499 --> 00:00:08.559
and read from

00:00:08.559 --> 00:00:09.109
up to down

00:00:09.109 --> 00:00:10.579
and right to left,

00:00:10.579 --> 00:00:11.759
sometimes with

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:12.559
diffuse meaning

00:00:12.559 --> 00:00:13.109
in Western languages.

00:00:19.759 --> 00:00:20.539
But also he

00:00:20.539 --> 00:00:21.559
understands that

00:00:21.559 --> 00:00:22.109
originally

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:22.579
each ideogram

00:00:22.579 --> 00:00:23.569
was the representation

00:00:23.569 --> 00:00:24.559
of an object,

00:00:24.559 --> 00:00:25.539
and there is no

00:00:25.539 --> 00:00:26.109
better way

00:00:26.109 --> 00:00:26.579
to return

00:00:26.579 --> 00:00:27.109
to the origin

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:27.939
than to let

00:00:27.939 --> 00:00:28.739
the character

00:00:28.739 --> 00:00:29.069
become a thing.

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:30.760
Again, this is

00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:31.710
his definition

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:32.760
of a calligram.

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:37.210
His Western education

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:38.102
mixed with Japanese roots

00:00:38.102 --> 00:00:39.102
places him in the

00:00:39.102 --> 00:00:40.112
middle of something,

00:00:40.112 --> 00:00:41.362
like a bridge.

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:43.530
All his pieces are made

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:44.630
in a special paper,

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:45.460
called kinwashi,

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:47.410
and traditional ink

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:48.559
sumi e follow

00:00:48.559 --> 00:00:49.559
the Zen circle,

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:50.410
the Enso.

00:00:52.312 --> 00:00:52.962
An allegory

00:00:52.962 --> 00:00:53.642
or homage

00:00:53.642 --> 00:00:54.042
to Ikigai,

00:00:54.042 --> 00:00:55.542
which is a beautiful

00:00:55.542 --> 00:00:56.142
Japanese concept

00:00:56.142 --> 00:00:57.272
that means

00:00:57.272 --> 00:00:58.042
"the purpose of life".

00:01:00.862 --> 00:01:01.102
This title,

00:01:01.102 --> 00:01:01.702
Watashi no Ikigai,

00:01:01.702 --> 00:01:02.702
means the purpose

00:01:02.702 --> 00:01:03.702
of my life.

00:01:06.632 --> 00:01:06.762
It is somehow

00:01:06.762 --> 00:01:07.202
freedom that

00:01:07.202 --> 00:01:07.762
the artist takes

00:01:07.762 --> 00:01:08.532
not only to

00:01:08.532 --> 00:01:09.532
write vertically,

00:01:12.112 --> 00:01:12.872
but also to

00:01:12.872 --> 00:01:13.132
write in a curved line.

00:01:14.765 --> 00:01:15.515
The piece has

00:01:15.515 --> 00:01:16.215
a poem that

00:01:16.215 --> 00:01:16.715
goes like this.

00:01:18.015 --> 00:01:18.895
Where the ethereal bird rests,

00:01:18.895 --> 00:01:19.795
where the morning dawns.

00:01:23.075 --> 00:01:23.935
That is you.

00:01:24.015 --> 00:01:24.985
Where the candle flame

00:01:24.985 --> 00:01:25.785
does not tremble,

00:01:25.785 --> 00:01:26.735
where the time

00:01:26.735 --> 00:01:27.735
of everything is marked.

00:01:31.175 --> 00:01:31.575
It is important

00:01:31.575 --> 00:01:32.475
to point out that the

00:01:32.475 --> 00:01:33.275
ideogram that is

00:01:33.275 --> 00:01:34.205
in the center of the

00:01:34.205 --> 00:01:35.305
painting is the word YOU

00:01:35.305 --> 00:01:36.865
and the piece is

00:01:36.865 --> 00:01:37.565
nothing more than a

00:01:37.565 --> 00:01:38.625
love letter

00:01:41.305 --> 00:01:41.965
to explain to the loved one

00:01:41.965 --> 00:01:42.665
that my purpose in life

00:01:42.665 --> 00:01:43.565
is basically you.
