Taro Yamada, his fascination for
seeing how unnatural Japanese

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:06.739
writing can be for the West.

00:00:07.499 --> 00:00:12.559
Unintelligible ideograms, words without
spaces written vertically, and read from

00:00:12.589 --> 00:00:18.109
up to down and right to left, sometimes
with diffuse meaning in Western languages.

00:00:19.759 --> 00:00:24.539
But also he understands that originally
each ideogram was the representation

00:00:24.579 --> 00:00:29.069
of an object, and there is no better
way to return to the origin than to

00:00:29.069 --> 00:00:30.939
let the character become a thing.

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:35.760
Again, this is his
definition of a calligram.

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:40.210
His Western education mixed with
Japanese roots places him in the

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:42.220
middle of something, like a bridge.

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:46.530
All his pieces are made in a
special paper, called kinwashi,

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:51.410
and traditional ink sumi e
follow the Zen circle, the Enso.

00:00:52.312 --> 00:00:58.042
An allegory or homage to Ikigai,
which is a beautiful Japanese concept

00:00:58.052 --> 00:01:00.372
that means "the purpose of life".

00:01:00.862 --> 00:01:06.102
This title, Watashi no Ikigai,
means the purpose of my life.

00:01:06.632 --> 00:01:11.762
It is somehow freedom that the artist
takes not only to write vertically,

00:01:12.112 --> 00:01:14.132
but also to write in a curved line.

00:01:14.765 --> 00:01:17.515
The piece has a poem that goes like this.

00:01:18.015 --> 00:01:22.395
Where the ethereal bird rests,
where the morning dawns.

00:01:23.075 --> 00:01:23.935
That is you.

00:01:24.015 --> 00:01:29.985
Where the candle flame does not tremble,
where the time of everything is marked.

00:01:31.175 --> 00:01:35.575
It is important to point out that the
ideogram that is in the center of the

00:01:35.575 --> 00:01:41.305
painting is the word YOU and the piece
is nothing more than a love letter

00:01:41.305 --> 00:01:48.065
to explain to the loved one that my
purpose in life is basically you.

00:01:49.172 --> 00:01:50.962
