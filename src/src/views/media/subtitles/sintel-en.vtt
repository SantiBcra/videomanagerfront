00:00:00.379 --> 00:00:00.709
When you

00:00:00.709 --> 00:00:01.430
see them on

00:00:01.430 --> 00:00:02.079
the freeway

00:00:02.079 --> 00:00:02.460
hitching

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:03.300
rides

00:00:03.829 --> 00:00:04.210
with their

00:00:04.210 --> 00:00:04.860
dogs and

00:00:04.860 --> 00:00:04.989

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:06.680
their sides,

00:00:07.030 --> 00:00:07.399
you need

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:07.820
to ask,

00:00:07.849 --> 00:00:08.229

Take

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:14.619
time out.

00:00:15.589 --> 00:00:16.099
When you see

00:00:16.099 --> 00:00:16.519
him with the

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:17.179
band around

00:00:17.179 --> 00:00:17.809
his head

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:19.140
and an army

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:20.100
surplus bunk

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:20.570
that makes

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:21.279

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:22.179
you need to

00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:22.660

Take

00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:29.994
time out.

00:00:30.515 --> 00:00:30.775
Take a

00:00:30.775 --> 00:00:31.324
minute, feel

00:00:31.334 --> 00:00:32.144
some sorrow

00:00:32.364 --> 00:00:32.605
for the

00:00:32.605 --> 00:00:33.035
folks who

00:00:33.035 --> 00:00:33.305
thought

00:00:33.305 --> 00:00:33.935
tomorrow

00:00:34.135 --> 00:00:34.695
was a place

00:00:34.695 --> 00:00:34.955
that they

00:00:34.955 --> 00:00:35.425
could call

00:00:35.425 --> 00:00:35.785
up on the

00:00:35.785 --> 00:00:36.265
phone.

00:00:37.985 --> 00:00:38.275
Take a

00:00:38.275 --> 00:00:38.765
month and

00:00:38.765 --> 00:00:39.265
show some

00:00:39.315 --> 00:00:40.085
kindness

00:00:40.364 --> 00:00:40.644
for the

00:00:40.655 --> 00:00:41.134
folks who

00:00:41.134 --> 00:00:41.634
thought that

00:00:41.634 --> 00:00:42.504
blindness

00:00:42.775 --> 00:00:43.195
was an

00:00:43.214 --> 00:00:43.804
illness that

00:00:43.804 --> 00:00:44.264
affected

00:00:44.265 --> 00:00:45.055
eyes alone.

00:00:46.614 --> 00:00:47.144
When you see

00:00:47.144 --> 00:00:47.784
her walking

00:00:47.784 --> 00:00:48.364
barefoot in

00:00:48.364 --> 00:00:48.955
the rain,

00:00:49.775 --> 00:00:49.915
and you

00:00:49.935 --> 00:00:50.435
know she's

00:00:50.435 --> 00:00:50.845
tripping

00:00:50.845 --> 00:00:51.245
on a one

00:00:51.245 --> 00:00:51.905
way train,

00:00:52.435 --> 00:00:52.975
you need to

00:00:52.975 --> 00:00:53.435
ask, what's

00:00:53.435 --> 00:00:53.795
all the

00:00:53.985 --> 00:00:54.745
selling,

00:00:55.035 --> 00:00:55.354
and the

00:00:55.354 --> 00:00:56.615
yelling, the

00:00:56.634 --> 00:00:57.655
beating, and

00:00:57.655 --> 00:00:58.304
the cheating

00:00:58.304 --> 00:00:58.785
all about?

00:00:59.884 --> 00:01:00.155
Take

00:01:00.155 --> 00:01:00.724
time out.

00:01:01.625 --> 00:01:01.995
Oh, you

00:01:01.995 --> 00:01:02.535
can sell

00:01:02.544 --> 00:01:03.044
your soul

00:01:03.044 --> 00:01:03.604
for money.

00:01:03.925 --> 00:01:04.384
Then run

00:01:04.384 --> 00:01:04.824
off to the

00:01:04.824 --> 00:01:05.275
country

00:01:05.444 --> 00:01:05.794
for your

00:01:05.794 --> 00:01:06.365
cookouts

00:01:06.365 --> 00:01:06.664
and your

00:01:06.664 --> 00:01:07.275
parties on

00:01:07.284 --> 00:01:08.074
the lawns.

00:01:08.845 --> 00:01:09.445
But our

00:01:09.445 --> 00:01:09.975
Children

00:01:09.975 --> 00:01:10.234
seek

00:01:10.234 --> 00:01:10.965
sedation

00:01:11.685 --> 00:01:12.394
in eastern

00:01:12.394 --> 00:01:13.285
meditation

00:01:13.764 --> 00:01:14.464
of visions

00:01:14.465 --> 00:01:14.845
that go

00:01:14.845 --> 00:01:15.505
shooting up

00:01:15.505 --> 00:01:16.044
their arms.

00:01:17.775 --> 00:01:18.065
Then you

00:01:18.095 --> 00:01:18.495
know that

00:01:18.495 --> 00:01:18.995
youth is

00:01:18.995 --> 00:01:19.555
dying on

00:01:19.555 --> 00:01:20.155
the run.

00:01:20.975 --> 00:01:21.414
And my

00:01:21.414 --> 00:01:21.854
daughter

00:01:21.854 --> 00:01:22.565
trades dope

00:01:22.565 --> 00:01:23.285
stories with

00:01:23.285 --> 00:01:23.794
your son.

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:25.030
We better

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:25.929
ask, what's

00:01:25.929 --> 00:01:26.220
all the

00:01:26.229 --> 00:01:27.440
bleeding and

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:28.209
the needing,

00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:29.209
the killing

00:01:29.449 --> 00:01:29.780
and the

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:30.530
thrilling

00:01:30.769 --> 00:01:31.440
all about?

00:01:31.959 --> 00:01:32.389
We better

00:01:32.389 --> 00:01:32.699
take

00:01:32.699 --> 00:01:33.299
time out

00:01:33.899 --> 00:01:34.639
and accept

00:01:34.639 --> 00:01:35.049
the fact

00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:36.560
that I am a

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:37.620
rainbow in

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:38.320
somebody's

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:38.730
cloud.

00:01:40.154 --> 00:01:40.744
Today,

00:01:41.204 --> 00:01:41.434
Maya

00:01:41.434 --> 00:01:42.054
Angelou's

00:01:42.074 --> 00:01:42.674
influence

00:01:42.684 --> 00:01:43.314
can be felt

00:01:43.314 --> 00:01:43.804
in every

00:01:43.804 --> 00:01:44.364
corner of

00:01:44.364 --> 00:01:44.904
the globe.

00:01:45.744 --> 00:01:46.204
Her words

00:01:46.204 --> 00:01:46.714
are quoted

00:01:46.714 --> 00:01:47.284
by world

00:01:47.284 --> 00:01:48.154
leaders and

00:01:48.154 --> 00:01:48.914
scrawled in

00:01:48.914 --> 00:01:49.584
the margins

00:01:49.584 --> 00:01:50.214
of student

00:01:50.284 --> 00:01:50.934
notebooks.

00:01:51.454 --> 00:01:52.274
Her life is

00:01:52.284 --> 00:01:52.854
studied in

00:01:52.854 --> 00:01:53.694
classrooms

00:01:53.994 --> 00:01:54.214
and her

00:01:54.214 --> 00:01:54.854
poetry is

00:01:54.854 --> 00:01:55.344
recited

00:01:55.344 --> 00:01:56.154
on stages.

00:01:56.974 --> 00:01:57.414
She is a

00:01:57.414 --> 00:01:57.994
testament

00:01:57.994 --> 00:01:58.584
to the power

00:01:58.584 --> 00:01:59.184
of the human

00:01:59.184 --> 00:02:00.404
spirit, a

00:02:00.404 --> 00:02:01.054
reminder

00:02:01.094 --> 00:02:01.424
that we

00:02:01.424 --> 00:02:01.844
are all

00:02:01.854 --> 00:02:02.464
capable of

00:02:02.464 --> 00:02:03.134
greatness,

00:02:03.214 --> 00:02:03.654
no matter

00:02:03.654 --> 00:02:04.134
where we

00:02:04.134 --> 00:02:05.094
come from or

00:02:05.094 --> 00:02:05.604
what we have

00:02:05.604 --> 00:02:06.144
endured.

00:02:06.974 --> 00:02:07.434
So let us

00:02:07.434 --> 00:02:07.944
remember

00:02:08.144 --> 00:02:09.114
Maya Angelou

00:02:09.624 --> 00:02:10.244
not just as

00:02:10.244 --> 00:02:11.094
a poet or an

00:02:11.104 --> 00:02:11.864
activist but

00:02:11.864 --> 00:02:12.504
as a woman

00:02:12.974 --> 00:02:13.414
who taught

00:02:13.414 --> 00:02:14.094
us that life

00:02:14.124 --> 00:02:15.584
is art, that

00:02:15.584 --> 00:02:16.264
words have

00:02:16.284 --> 00:02:17.379
power, and

00:02:17.379 --> 00:02:18.124
that we all

00:02:18.154 --> 00:02:18.794
have a story

00:02:18.794 --> 00:02:19.304
to tell.

00:02:20.254 --> 00:02:20.594
Let her

00:02:20.594 --> 00:02:21.754
life inspire

00:02:21.754 --> 00:02:22.804
us, let her

00:02:22.804 --> 00:02:23.594
words move

00:02:23.594 --> 00:02:24.664
us, and let

00:02:24.664 --> 00:02:25.404
her legacy

00:02:25.474 --> 00:02:26.214
remind us

00:02:26.244 --> 00:02:26.934
of the power

00:02:27.294 --> 00:02:27.864
of the human

00:02:27.864 --> 00:02:28.344
spirit.

00:02:29.074 --> 00:02:29.934
Each piece
